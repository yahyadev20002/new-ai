# Ethereal Shapes - Premium Side-Interactive Animated Website

A professional React-based storytelling website featuring **side-positioned animated shapes** that interact dynamically with content as users scroll. Experience the magic of morphing geometric forms positioned on the sides of the screen that respond to mouse movement, scroll progress, and user interactions.

## 🌟 Premium Features

### 🎯 Side-Positioned Interactive Shapes
- **Left-side main shape**: Large morphing geometric form with gradient animations
- **Right-side secondary shape**: Complementary circular element with dynamic responses
- **Mouse tracking**: Shapes respond to cursor movement with parallax effects
- **Hover interactions**: Enhanced scaling and glow effects on user interaction

### 🎨 Advanced Visual Effects
- **Animated gradients**: Color-shifting gradients with smooth transitions
- **Enhanced particle system**: 30+ floating particles with varied sizes and animations
- **Connection lines**: Dynamic SVG lines connecting the shapes
- **Scroll progress indicator**: Visual feedback showing scroll position
- **Professional glow effects**: Multi-layered drop shadows and filters

### 🔄 Dynamic Scroll Interactions
- **Section-based reactions**: Shapes respond when content sections enter viewport
- **Horizontal movement**: Shapes move horizontally based on scroll progress
- **Morphing animations**: Seamless shape transformations synchronized with content
- **Color transitions**: Dynamic color changes based on scroll position

### 💫 Professional Animations
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: Precise scroll-synchronized animations
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth micro-interactions and hover effects
- **Lenis smooth scrolling**: Butter-smooth scroll experience
- **Spring physics**: Natural movement with spring-based animations

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Shape Configuration
Edit `src/components/ShapeAnimator/shapes.json` for professional shape states:
```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "hero",
      "shapePath": "M50,10 L90,90 L10,90 Z",
      "color": "#6366f1",
      "scale": 1,
      "rotation": 0,
      "opacity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Side Interactions
Content automatically wraps around side shapes using responsive margins:
```tsx
<ScrollSection
  id="about"
  title="Professional Title"
  description="Engaging content that interacts with side shapes"
  className="lg:ml-96"  // Creates space for left-side shape
/>
```

### Advanced Effects
Customize particle systems, glow effects, and animations in `ShapeAnimator.tsx`.
