### 🔐 Authentication Required for Final Step

The final push command requires GitHub authentication. You have several options:

#### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# On macOS:
brew install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

#### Option 2: Using Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope
3. Use the token when prompted for password:
```bash
git push -u origin main
# Username: yahyadev20002
# Password: your_personal_access_token
```

#### Option 3: Using SSH (More Secure)
```bash
# Generate SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Start SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add SSH key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add the key to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

# Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yahyadev20002/new-ai.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```
